# 0hh1 Solver

A solver for the game [0hh1](http://0hh1.com), written entirely in Swift.

The game always allows there be a way to solve each puzzle without requiring that you play ahead, as you may do with Sudoku (going forward with numbers you have no certainty about, to test their validity). As such, this code attempts to solve each puzzle using regular techniques, rather than guessing ahead, as may happen with a Sudoku solver.
